      <p className="text-center">I was worked in FnB Industry and now I shift my career to Front End Engineer. I passed
      the Alterra Academy Immersive bootcamp for 3 months and learn many things about
      UI/UX Design and Front End Engineering such as ReactJS & NextJS framework, HTML,
      CSS, and Tailwind. I have created projects like E-Commerce, Social Media App and
      Realtime Location Chat App . Until now Iâ€™ve created around 4 UI web designs and 11
      web projects : 2 React projects and 3 Next projects with backend integration and 7 web
      projects based on HTML,CSS and Javascript. I have a high interest in IT, especially
      Front-End Engineering and enjoy my time to develop and keep learning more
      technology to come.</p>
